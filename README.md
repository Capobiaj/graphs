# Program files contain python implementations of undirected graphs and directed graphs via adjacency lists. 

# Undirected graphs are stored as a python dictionary of lists where keys are vertex names and the values
# are lists with names of vertices connected to the 'key' vertex. 

# Directed graphs are stored as a two dimensional matrix, or a list of lists, with the element on the i-th
# row and j-th column in the matric as the weight of the edge going from the vertex with index i to the 
# vertex with index j. In the case where there is no edge, the value is zero.
